# HashPokemonGo
Live sentiment analysis on pokemon in a x km radius - this can be easily implemented expanding on the work done last semester https://github.com/Rostlab/JS16_ProjectD_Group5 . We also want to know what people think about that Pokemon! So the user of the app should be able to visualize a live sentiment feed around his/her area (that is, given a lat/lng and a specific radius), and be able to see if people around him/her think positively or negatively about that pokemon. Additionally, since you will become the twitter experts, you will join forces with project A to realize the live-tweet miner.
